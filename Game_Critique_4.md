# Synopsis
A game that pits players from around the world against each other--and devious AI--to build the rep, prestige, and bankroll needed to be, and beat, the best of the best.

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
Plays almost like a real life poker game. With an add sense of ridiculousness.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single player against A.I. and multiplayer against other players.
### Controls
Controls are good after a little play time.

# Bugs
Against A.I. the game seems a little predetermend and or rigged.
Against players you can tell whos good and whose not by the rep level of each player.
# Final Thoughts
its fun if u know how to play poker. If not your gonna have a bad time. Thats kind of how this game boils down. That and a small amount of luck and or faith in the cards.
