# Game Play Summary
### Playability
Controls take some getting used to but after you got them down it becomes natrual makeing gameplay smooth and effeortless.
### Single/Multiplayer
You can play Warframe solo but I wouldn't advise anyone to do that unless they're in a quest that the have to do themselves, really good or speed running a mission. Otherwise Warframe is PvE online multiplayer or PvP in conclave. 
### Controls
As stated before controls get some geting used to. You can also reasign buttons to different functions like the melee and interaction, or map and gear wheel on the directional pad.

# Bugs
1. Radomally telepoterd through walls and returned to a previous point in time while I was on a mission. 
2. While spamming my melee button and turning my warframe to attack more enemies I feel through the map. later respawned right where I fell.
3. While playing higher leveled enemies (43-50) I noticed that the number of ammo in magazine wasnt decreasing. I noticed that it happened at random times and allowed me to fire 100s of shots without reloading. I dont know if this was a glitch, or something someone in my squad used.  
# Final Thoughts
Ive been playing Warframe for awhile now so this might be biased but I like it more then other shooters. Mainly because it makes you think more then other shooters like Call of Duty or Destiny. Plus, D.E. is always adding new stuff to the game. Just last wek D.E. released and open world map the its PC version and a new Warframe with weopans of course. Yes there are some glitchs but D.E. is usally fast with hotfixs or fixes and tweaks in their next update.
