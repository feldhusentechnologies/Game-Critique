# Final Thoughts
I dont do alot of mobile gaming. But, when I do I perfer ones that are addictive to play. With its simplistic gamplay reminiscent of some of the best mobile games in the past like the rage inducing flappy birds. 50 Loops has that along with a Tron futuristic feel and graphics. Along with the music this game is a great casuel game on android.
