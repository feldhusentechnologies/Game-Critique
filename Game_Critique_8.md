# Final Thoughts
EA has had a bad wrap in recent history, with developers they've worked with going out of business, to scraping game franchises. 
And now with microtransactions in Star Wars Battlefront 2 which is a sixty dollar game to begin with.
Which has angered many gamers and one of the reasons a comment made by EA lead to the most downvoted post in reddit ever.
Despite that I enjoyed to game itselfs. But, yes, it would be better without micortransactions ruining the game balance between players.
