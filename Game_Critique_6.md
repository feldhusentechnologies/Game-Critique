# Bugs
PS4 got a fatal error and all my play data was lost.
Got into a stuck spot when I tried to kill an orc in exact same spot. Ended up unable to move and dying.
# Final Thoughts
Its not bad but is not as great as the commercails made it out to be. Or like the first one when it was like Assassins creed in Mordor.
Plus Micropayments. Would be better if Warner brothers Werent trying to milk you for your cash.
