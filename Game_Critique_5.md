touchscreen directional keys and a fighting menu almost identical to older versions of pokemon.
# Bugs
Loading a saved game didn't always work.

# Final Thoughts
Like most people i like rick and morty. Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon tell it a funny story about the existential crisis most
people have had in the lifes and poke fun at it. So i thought the game would be a little more in depth like the show, which its not. 
Plus with the council of ricks being now all dead, it makes fighting them as the "Gym Leaders" seem like a mute point. Otherwise , I like the homage to
older pokemon games when the were still 2d, but like most gamers i could do with the micropayments.
